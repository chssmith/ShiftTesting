        Roanoke College is committed to providing the safest environment
        possible for the prevention and spread of COVID-19 while still meeting
        our mission of educating our students.  We are following guidance from
        the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American College Health
        Association (ACHA), and The Virginia Department of Health (VDH).

      <p>
        Safety is everyoneâ€™s responsibility, and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown
        us how crucial it is for all Maroons to make a commitment to safety to
        lessen the likelihood of an uncontrollable outbreak occurring on campus.
        The entire college community needs to do their part to make safety a
        personal priority.  Your electronic signature indicates a commitment to
        these practices.
