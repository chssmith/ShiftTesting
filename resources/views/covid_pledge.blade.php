				Roanoke College is committed to doing its part to provide an environment that
				will limit the introduction and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while still
				meeting our mission of educating our students.  Guidance on safety measures
				continues to evolve.  We are endeavoring to follow safety guidance from the
				Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American College Health Association (ACHA),
				and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), and the recent regulations issued
				by the Virginia Department of Labor & Industry.
      </p>

      <p>
				Safety is everyoneâ€™s responsibility, and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how
				crucial it is for all Maroons to make a commitment to take preventative steps to
				lessen the likelihood of an uncontrollable outbreak occurring on campus.  The
				entire college community needs to do their part to be safe and to make the
				safety of others a personal priority.  Your electronic signature indicates a
				commitment to these practices.

      <ul>
        <li>
          I will follow the campus guidelines designed to address and mitigate
          the risks of COVID-19.
        </li>
				<li>
					I will take responsibility for my health and for my part in protecting
					the health of all those who are part of my campus. I understand the
					best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus.
				</li>
				<li>
					I will practice good hygiene skills (covering coughs and sneezes),
					washing my hands after being public places and avoid touching my eyes,
					nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
				</li>
        <li>
        	I will follow the Face Covering Policy of the college and maintain
        	social distance when not wearing a facial covering to protect my
        	campus.
        </li>
				<li>
					I will educate myself on the symptoms associated with COVID-19.
				</li>
        <li>
					When I first notice COVID-19 symptoms, I will immediately
					self-quarantine, promptly contact the appropriate campus authority,
					and then follow the directions provided.
        </li>
				<li>
					I will avoid close contact with people who I know are sick with
					COVID-19.
				</li>
        <li>
					If I become aware that in the past 14 days I have been directly
					exposed to COVID-19 by way of close contact with someone who has
					tested positive, I will promptly contact appropriate campus authority
					and then follow the directions provided.
        </li>
        <li>
        	I will be flexible in my working and learning environments and put
        	forth my best effort.
        </li>
